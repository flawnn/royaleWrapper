# royaleWrapper
Hey there! (This Project is on Progress, I am currently busy)
This is a API-Wrapper for the unofficial Clash Royale API "CR-API" (cr-api.com).
I was focusing on a fast Wrapper, which gives you (unfortunately) a non-Async Result. I would really appreciate it, if you are going to give me Feedback to this! If there is a other problem just open an Issue!

# Prerequisites
If you are using Maven or Gradle import the Jsoniter Dependency, version can be any. If you don't use a Dependency Management System, just go to http://jsoniter.com and download it.

# Coming Soon
- Async API Calls
- Better Implementation of Models and raw Data
